# Mario Kart Wii - Music Pack Downloader

## What is this?
This is a bash script created for the purpose of downloading and constucting Mario Kart Wii music packs. 
It does this by processing a json file containing information on the music pack; including track listing, and loop information. 

## Why would you do this?
Music packs are usually annoying to download, as they are large, and downloads are only usually found in yt descriptions. 
Download links can also often go missing, and making updates requires another large download. 
This script attempts to fix this by making downloading music packs reliant on a text file, and multiple websites. 

### Additional info
Many MKWii mods nowadays contain an automatic brsar patcher meaning a patched revokart.brsar is often not needed. 
However, if using this pack standalone, or alongside a mod that doesn't automatically patch revokart, you will need to obtain a copy of revokart and patch it yourself. 
This script does not obtain or patch it for you. 

### Requirements and Dependencies
This script requires a few programs in order to work. 
	> ffmpeg - Required for brstm conversion. 
	> openrevolution (Must be compiled) - Required for brstm conversion. 
	> wget - Required for downloading of files.
